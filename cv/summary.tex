I am physicist, turned software developer, turned evolutionary biologist. I currently study protein evolution -- particularly the mechanisms that shape how proteins evolve. My research is motivated by the broad question: \textit{how does a protein's genotype-phenotype map shape its evolution?}. Specifically, I have written a lot about epistasis and how it shapes evolutionary trajectories in protein genotype-phenotype maps. I am also passionate about open and reproducible science. Adjacent to my research, I work hard to develop software that makes reproducibility simple.
